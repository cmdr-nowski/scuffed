Tool to experiment with system colony builds for Elite Dangerous

This is an experimental version of [syscol_helper](https://github.com/cmdr-nowski/syscol_helper/)

- Try it at https://cmdr-nowski.github.io/scuffed/
- Url encoding for system plans, e.g. https://cmdr-nowski.github.io/scuffed/#DFrIS45ehg==
- Models the dependencies and construction points requirements
- Provides basic hauling info
- Keeps track of system status effects, basic economy facts
- Click green '+' signs to add facilities 
- Click green column headers to filter
- Export and import for saving system builds to a simple text file
- Undo and redo adding facilities
- Support for [construction point price hikes](https://forums.frontier.co.uk/threads/elite-dangerous-system-colonisation-beta-details-feedback.634055/post-10572014) after building two additional major assets
- Basic javascript only, no dependencies, run it at home
- 90's html skills on show
- UI/UX - I've heard of them
- Strictly WIP. No warranty. Hours and days spent hauling commodities are the sole responsibility of the hauler.
- Patches welcome!
